drush drake
===========

Drush Drake is the engine for executing migration scripts. Each drake script is a collection of drush commands, which are executed via the "drush drake" command. After a drake script is executed, it is logged in the database as executed so that it will not execute twice. 

A drake file name must consist of a version number and the suffix ".drake". You must use higher numbers for newer scripts!
Drake files have to reside in a "migrations" folder within any module or an installation profile. The engine finds them all and allows you to run all scripts or only those
of a special module/profile up to a specific version.

example script
--------------

    my_module/migrations/7100.drake
    ; this migration for the 7-1.x version of "my_module" downloads all required dependencies and clears the cache
    dl views
    enable views
    cc all

Any valid drush commands are here allowed.

drake command
--------------

The drake command expects an optional version number and a module/profile name or "all". Examples:

    ; runs all migrations in all modules
    drush drake-migrate all
    ; runs all migrations up to the version 7100 of the module "my_module"
    drush drake-migrate 7100 my_module
    ; runs all migrations of the install profile "my_install_profile"
    drush drake-migrate my_install_profile
